# Final Project
## Object Oriented Programming

‘Endless Fighter’ is a 2D pixel-art fighting game where you play as a character endlessly fighting against non-stop waves of zombies, equipped with a melee attack and ice shard projectiles. The objective is to collect stars that are dropped by eliminated zombies to try and beat the high score of highest number of stars obtained in a single run. The player is given three health hearts every run, but no respawns.
